## Set up the GitHub
1. New Environment : Create and activate an environment first
2. Initialize and setup the repository
3. Create .gitignore in repository
4. Create setup.py -- It'll be responsible for creating my ML Application as a package.
5. Create folder `src` and under it file `__init__.py`: This can be imported like libraries. All the project development inside this folder.
6. Create requirements.txt -- store packages to be used. At last, we'll mention `-e .` which will automatically trigger setup.py file.

#### To install Libraries
- `pip install -r requiremnts.txt`
